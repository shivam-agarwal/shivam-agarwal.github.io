I am a final year Masters student in ["International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore"](http://www.iiitb.ac.in). 

After procrastinating for a long time, I have started to write my blog. The aim of this blog is to share somethings which I have worked on in past and on which I currently am working. It also aims to create a healthy discussion on some really cool ideas and collaborate to build something new and useful.
