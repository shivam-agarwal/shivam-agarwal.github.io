    <p>What do we mean by the word humanity? Is it a way to describe acts of kindness towards another human/animal? What’s the word for cruelty towards the same then? And finally - shouldn’t humanity be the duty of a living being, necessary to co-exist?
<!-- more --></p>

<p>I recently visited Goa and simply loved the place. The city is so different than others in India. Everybody chills out without disturbing others. The experience of riding Scooty with friends on sea shores, having a dip in sea anytime you feel like and the awesome food makes you feel just like in heaven. </p>

<p>But I had a very strange encounter with a situation which forced me to think. We were at Baga beach, enjoying the company of friends and good food. Around 1 AM, a poor family of three - mother, a little girl of 7 and an elder brother of 15 began to perform their stunts with fire. Everybody was mesmerized at the talent of the boy who was playing very easily with fire. </p>

<p>At the end of the performance, he collected money and people settled down. Just then a person gave 100 bucks to the mother and forced the little girl to have a drink. </p>

<p>Imagine the  situation. There were 15 occupied tables around 35 people on an average. Everybody watched the act, spared the change and settled again at their tables. But when the guy physically forced the little girl, no one was even bothered. I understand why the mother was not reacting as for her 100 bucks were more important than the dignity of her children. But why not others? 
Why didn’t anyone present there, react? </p>

<p>The guy went on to put a solo chair in front of the little girl and asked her to dance. This went on for at least full 10 minutes. </p>

<p>Why do we feel the inability to stand up against something utterly wrong in front of our own eyes? What holds us? Why don’t we have the strength to get up and do something? If we feel so helpless imagine the state of the victim and that too a little girl of 7 years.</p>

<p>See I am in no way a leader or an “inspirer”. I am still forming my own beliefs. I look out for inspiration and for someone to follow. But I am starting to feel like that there is no such person. Now I am starting to understand the true meaning of the famous poem “Invictus” by William E. Henley: <br /></p>

<p class="para-center" style="font-style: italic; ">
Out of the night that covers me,  <br />
Black as the pit From pole to pole, <br />
I thank whatever gods may be <br />
For my unconquerable soul. <br />
<br />
In the fell clutch of circumstance <br />
I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance <br />
My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br />
<br />
Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br />
Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br />
And yet the menace of the years <br />
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. <br />
<br />
It matters not how strait the gate, <br />
How charged with punishments the scroll, <br />
I am the master of my fate: <br />
I am the captain of my soul. <br />
</p>

<p><br />
The theme of this post should not be to understand how optimist or pessimist I am and judge me. Believe me, I will write other posts which will allow you to do so. I write this only in the spirit to highlight the fear we all have inside. It reminds me of a quote - </p>

<p class="para-center" style="font-style: italic; font-weight:600">
"Courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgement that something is more important than fear; <br />The brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all."</p>

<p>After witnessing the inhumane acts of that guy for about 10 minutes, we went to handle the situation. I didn’t even talk to the guy. I took the family aside and talked to them. Told the mother that money was not that important (but then I don’t know the pain hunger brings). Reassured elder brother that what he has is an amazing talent and just believe in yourself, these days will be over soon. At this point the little girl who was standing by her brother said something to me. The emotion was so pure that I was unable to say anything after that. She said - “Thank you bhaiya!”</p>

<p>We think we uplift the life of beggar by giving some money? No. Because mostly we do it to get rid of the person from our face. The biggest gift we can give others is to believe in them and reassure them of hope.</p>
