- Extended part of family

Let me ask you a very direct question. Why do we need extended family? Here by extended family I mean all the blood relation except your parents and siblings. I have always thought of this but was never able to organize my thoughts before. Today I try that.

Family in earlier times was considered as one where there is bond of love with a common lineage. But is that it? No. Family is the first point of contact where one goes for consultation. At least it was in earlier days. 

Today I do not see that happenning. Now it has become nothing more than just a permanent guest list which is taken out of box only to send invites for certain occassions in life. But should be only like this? If yes then what is the purpose of maintaining the relations?

The questions may be blunt but their realization is the first step towards correction. 

I have always been so furious that inspite of having a large family, why there is no elder person to guide through various events of life. Whether it be academic, career or social. My goal is not to let this happen to younger generation. But how to achieve that when we have become so separate now? How to suggest something which is genuinely beneficial, without being perceived as beneficiary in some way? 

I seriously want to thank my Mamaji for suggesting and encouraging my mother a good education for me and my siblings. We cannot thank him enough. Because of the education only, we are today able to make ourselves independent financially. We cannot repay that debt ever and this is exactly my idea of a family - how it must be !!
