What is appreciation and why is it necessary? Almost all of us need to be appreciated. Sometimes we desire it most for our particular work and from an important person in our lives.

Think about it for a moment.An employee wants to be appreciated by their manager while discussing his/her rating, wives want to be appreciated by their husband, husbands want to be acknowledged after fixing an electrical crisis at home or for some other macho work, bachelor's want to be appreciated by friends after buying a new luxurious piece of comfort and a daily wage worker wants to appreciate himself/herself that they survived another day.

The post is about how we ourselves define our need of appreciation. The need of appreciation can originate from various reasons, including both good and bad ones. There is another aspect which I am feeling now. You sometimes do not know whether your works are good or bad. You expect, with your whole heart and soul that someone important to you should appreciate your work.

Now hold on to this thought. Why I am eager to discover and think more about this feeling is because it is related to that time of our academics when in a very short time we suddenly lost interest in a subject. Think about it, whether there was any such moment in your life where you were good in a particular subject and in a very short time you suddenly lost it? 

Did that happen because of the case where you did some work, which you didn't know was worthy enough and were not appreciated? The result - did you gave up?

I think of appreciation and motivation as the most important and the most powerful tools for a teacher. They are like uranium. The decision of how and when to use them can lead to either constructive or equally destructive consequences, just like an atomic plant or a nuclear bomb respectively. The only difference with these and a nuclear bomb is, not using them will also lead to a destructive event i.e. losing a student's interest in a subject.
