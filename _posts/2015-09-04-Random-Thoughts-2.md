**First thread:**

I don't understand the way we think and make a mapping of certain things in our lives. It's very interesting and shocking. 


<!-- more -->

Is there no party where food is not the central theme? Can we not engage ourselves in a party to do something constructive? Why do we think twice while helping out a poor guy but not even once while ordering another beer, even when we know we have had enough? :P, or while paying extra to make our journey a bit more comfortable? See the point is not to discourage the things we normally do according to whatever mapping we have. The point I want to emphasize is that have we accepted these mappings to be the only way? The result of which - have we stopped exploring?

Why exploration is important? It is because while exploring the unknown, we sometimes discover ourselves. 

**Second thread:**

I don't understand how people get alarmed and predict dangers of future when we spend Rs. 540/- for a humane act and are surprisingly normal when we are spending thousands on luxury, on clothes we have not worn in years or on the unhealthy food we very often eat? And to remind you unhealthy food not only harms economically but also financially.

It seems that I am in that phase of life where I consider every person wrong, other than me:P. I know that this too shall pass, but I am so eager to learn its answers when that happens.

**Third thread:**

I know that I am not going to have enough money in life w.r.t. others. But here is what I know for sure. 

I know that I will have just enough to sustain a decent life. A life for me or family where there is no shortage of basic necessities. I also know that other people earning more than me will not disturb me ever (I am testing it now - so yeah results are pending :P), but not making my life worthy of living will definitely be major disturbance. And according to me a worthy life is one where you sometimes help lives of others.


**Fourth thread:**

I do not consider myself introvert but I guess less social would be a better fit. The problem with being less social is that you are often lonely and advantage is that you are mostly alone!!!!
