While I was preparing for GATE examination 2 years back, I wrote few lines. These lines describes the effort I was able to put in. Today I stumbled on it and thought to share. So here are the lines which kept me going:
<br /><br />
<!-- more -->

<p class="para-center" style = "font-style: italic; font-weight:600">TRAPPED  OUTSIDE </p>
 
<p class="para-center" style = "font-style: italic;">

With all the time in world, <br />
yet no time to be. <br />
a long road lies ahead <br />
and there's no one but me. <br />
 <br />
sentenced for time with a hope of trail <br />
been trapped outside in a barless jail <br />
what binds me are not physical chains <br />
but a question- What you are going to be? <br />
 <br />
World's a strange place to be <br />
a lot are wet in rain while others enjoy their hot tea <br />
 <br />
It's not that bad at all you see, <br />
coz it gives a fair chance to thee <br />
we can either complain "i had a great fall" <br />
or can rise again like tides of sea. <br />
 <br />
So I rise again and say this- <br />
"I stand tall, and you try make me fall.<br />
give it your best and <br /> 
  <br /> 
              CHALLENGE ME !!!! " <br />
