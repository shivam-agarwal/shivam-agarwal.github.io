Sounds bizarre. What is a perfect weekend? How do you quantify a weekend? How do you take into account different perspectives of people? ...

Well you don't. This post is going to be about how you can try something different and at last speak -"That was a perfect weekend!". 

I, as many of us are, spent almost a year in Bangalore with watching movies/videos and/or facebook/youtube on weekends. And now I can tell you that I was a big idiot to spend them like that. After getting bored being in a room, went and watched movies in malls, had meals in restaurants etc. I gotta admit, being with friends is a lot of fun. So yeah the second way was more fun. Then I came across a third way to spend them.

I will never be able to thank Amit and Pankaj enough for introducing me to running and exercising respectively :P. They helped to discover a third way to spend and make a weekend perfect. The idea is damn simple: BE ACTIVE !!!. That's it. That is my great discovery. So rudimentary.

But just for a second do the math: how much do we spend on a movie and a follow up with meal in restaurant? And during this time how much time are we really connecting with each other? And now think how much interaction is there in any team sport. That's my point: if you are spending the same amount in different activity which gives you more time interacting and having fun with friends, then which one should we choose?

The choice is really yours. But as an experiment try something different this weekend and feel the difference. Just for a start and to reduce cost: have a swim with friends in society pool, play table tennis/cricket/football, do cycling and the best one - go for a running in group. You won't believe how much fun you'll have running with friends. Just for some inspiration - discover more about Ironman triathlon which happens every year in Hawai.

**Stop procrastinating, be active and really connect with your dear friends !!!**
