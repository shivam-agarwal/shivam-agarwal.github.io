I've been reading a book titled **"The Tao of Pooh" by Benjamin Hoff**. The book beautifully describes the concept of **effortless doing**. In other words, **doing something without overdoing**. It relates the concepts of Taoism with a very old cartoon of Winnie the Pooh...

I love the idea of Taoism and even more I loved the way author related it to the cartoon. I think people who really liked the cartoon of Winnie the pooh will surely be amazed when they read the relation author makes. It gives a different perspective.

What I want to share in this article is the thought that is the principle of **"effortless doing"** practically possible in a country like India? Recently I went to a wedding of a friend. Rituals spanned the whole night. Just to get some fresh air I went outside at 6 o clock in morning. I was surprised at first to see children of 11 and 12 standard all dressed with packed up lunch boxes, driving their bicycle going for studies at such an early hour. They won't return to their homes for atleast 11 hours. 3 hours of coaching in morning followed by 7 hours of school and then again 2 hours classes after that.
It is damn hectic.

Why I say this is to get a better understanding of principles of Taoism. Some questions linger in my mind, like **is the concept of effortless doing not applicable in age group of students?** specially in a place which is overflowing with competition? Or is it only for certain class and age of people in society? 

I don't know the answers of them yet, but I think I will find them out eventually and hoping effortlessly!!
