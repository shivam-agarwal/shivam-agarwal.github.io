Lot of things going on in life. With the end of Masters course, comes a time to take some hard decisions. Decisions which builds you, challenge and define you.

I have a  question. Getting a job in any company(general) will eventually define the path of your career. The work you will be assigned there, the strategy company management will take and the path decided by others will create the need of work which eventually you will end up doing right now. So the question is, how to leave one's career decision on somene's else's motives and luck?


This question is driving me to think seriously towards a higher degree through which I eventually want to achieve some independence towards achieving my goal in life. There is another feeling which is driving me to stay in campus for some more time. I still feel a bit gap left in M. Tech. education which I want to fulfill.

If doing mistakes made anyone rich, I would be by now the richest man alive. I think making mistakes is a luxury which everybody cannot afford. But repeating them is foolishness and learning from them is intelligence.
