Once in a while you get so many thoughts that you actually cannot understand whether what you are doing is right or wrong. There are such times when one wants something but in keeping long term goal in mind, one does not do anything towards it and sometimes its just plain laziness. :P

I think happiness is an extremely quantifiable and subjective quantity. A child is happy when given a chocolate, but it doubles when given two. We grown ups are so much caught up in today's 3 x 5 inch screen that we are always busy without any work. It is tempting me to measure the amount of time I waste when I install all the travel, shopping and entertainment apps. The disturbance is not from having them, but from their constant reminders which pop up every now and then saying - "hello, we apps exist!!". I am thinking to shutdown my smartphone for a few days just to realize whether it is productive or not. 

Thinking of spending this birthday in a bit different manner. Will keep you updated!!!
