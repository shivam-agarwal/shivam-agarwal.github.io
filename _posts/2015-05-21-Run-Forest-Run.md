Once upon a time, there was a child

a bit ashthematic, thinking - "will this unwind?"

<br />

In every PE class he sat on stands,

while others ran fast, he gave glance

<br />

Noone cared what was he missing,

coz everytime he ran, his heart was pounding

<br />
<!-- more -->

Years went by and he also didn't care

there was much to do, he thought

and said, "at least I am breathing same air"

<br />

nine years went by, he didn't care

And one day, a friend said

"I will run beside you, atleast try"

<br />

Then he ran with friend for the first time

he was happy even with 15 min. a mile !!!

<br />


Yeah that child is me. For almost my entire life I was not able to run for even 600 meters without gasping for air. But now I am so happy and thankful to the friend to make me realize the fun in running. Earlier I saw some running events in my hometown and I used to think- "what are they doing?". On 17 May 2015, for the first time I became "they". I ran 6 km in TCS Bangalore run. 

It felt so amazing that I cannot describe it in words. The people had awesome energy. People of every age group were running with each other, telling all the way to keep going and not to stop. Result? Everybody, I mean everyone there, inspite of their body condition, completed the run.

I guess that's the power of optimism. It influences more if it comes from other person. There's a quote - __“You don't see the world as it is, you see it, as you are.”__ I have been an audience of running event as well as a participant and the experience of both is world's apart. 

I will continue running because it regenerates optimism and recharges with positive energy. And I guess those are enough ingredients to achieve any dream. Isn't it? 

P.S.: You don't believe it? Give it a try ...
