Exactly one month from today, our work in IIIT-B will be officially finished. Farewell from any place brings a lot of memories and thoughts. Thoughts which lead a person to fetch answers of some questions like - how fruitful it was, what next etc.

Currently I am tied up in my thesis work and have to finish it with full zeal and concentration. Though I have not done very significant amount of work, it surely has removed the fear of few subjects. For this I will be very thankful to my supervisor and friends.
